## 🚀 Skills That Fuel My Orbit

- **Expertise Area**: Data Structures and Algorithms (my trusty starship navigators), Object-Oriented Programming (my code constellations), and UI/UX (because aesthetics matter in the vast expanse).
- **Programming Languages**: Java, C, C++, R, Python, Kotlin, and even a dash of Haskell (because variety is the spice of code life).
- **Tools and Technologies**: Git (my intergalactic time machine), HTML/CSS (for crafting pixel nebulae), MySQL (where data galaxies reside), Figma (my design wormhole), and Premiere Pro/Lightroom (for editing cosmic selfies).

## 🌌 Technical Electives: My Constellation Courses

- Data Structures (because linked lists are like cosmic strings)
- Computer Organization (where bits and bytes align in celestial harmony)
- Computer Graphics (turning polygons into shooting stars)
- Advanced Programming in Java (where interfaces meet event horizons)
- Mobile Computing (because our devices are our pocket black holes)
- Operating System (where processes orbit like binary planets)
- DBMS (because databases are the cosmic libraries of knowledge)

## 🛸 Projects: My Galactic Expeditions

1. **DataGene: Your Complete Data Solution Group**
   - Developed a dynamic database management app using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Gemini AI.
   - Users can create databases, define attributes, and perform CRUD operations.
   - Integrated with the Gemini chat platform for cosmic data discussions.
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/Divinejmd13/DataGene)

2. **Khabar: Your Local News App**
   - Built a cutting-edge news app in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and Gemini AI.
   - Geolocation-based news updates—because news travels at warp speed.
   - Users can even ask questions about specific articles (like querying quasars).
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/Divinejmd13/KhabarNews_App.git)

3. **Billing App Development in Kotlin**
   - Solo mission: Billing app using Kotlin, Firebase, and Jetpack Compose (MVVM architecture).
   - Real-time data management for inventory, categories, and transactions.
   - Intuitive UI—because even aliens appreciate good design.
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/Divinejmd13/BillingApp)

4. **Retail Shop Database**
   - Crafted an efficient e-commerce DBMS using Python and MySQL.
   - Live inventory management, categorization, and discount warp drives.
   - Automated ordering system for low-stock scenarios (because no one likes out-of-stock wormholes).
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/Divinejmd13/RetailShopDatabase)

5. **Application Development in Java**
   - Commanded the "Tank Star" game using LIBGDX and GRADLE.
   - OOP-powered gameplay, intricate mechanics, and graphics that rival cosmic phenomena.
   - [Game Link](#your-game-link)

6. **Computer-Generated Pen-and-Ink Illustration**
   - Unleashed a rendering system using OpenGL and C++.
   - Configured a 3D BSP tree for efficient polygon navigation.
   - Because sometimes, art is the language of the cosmos.
